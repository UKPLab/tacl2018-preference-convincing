\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Many tasks are more suited to pairwise comparisons than classification etc. 
Crowds of non-expert annotators may label more accurately if presented with pairs. 
Implicit feedback may be taken from user actions in an application that can be represented as a preference, such as choosing
an option over other options.

There are several works for learning from noisy pairwise comparisons so far (Horvitz et al. 2013 or something like that?). 
However, these do not provide a way to take account of item features or to model different but valid subjective viewpoints. 
They assume there is a single ground truth and can therefore model only one task and one user's (or a consensus of all users) preferences at once. 

Work by Felt et al. 2015, Simpson et al. 2015 etc. shows that item features are particularly useful when combining crowdsourced data. A Gaussian process has not been tested for this purpose before?

GP preference learning presents a way to learn from noisy preferences but assumes constant noise and a single underlying preference function. 
The collaborative Gaussian process (Houlsby et al. 2012) learns multiple users' preferences. 
However existing implementations do not scale and do not identify ground truth. 

We show how to scale it using SVI and how to use the model to identify ground truth from subjective preferences. 

%Things we assume are discussed in the intro:
% -- recommendation -- item-item similarity, user-user similarity (CF), user-item matching
% -- learning from implicit preferences/user actions
% -- need to handle sparsity i.e. most pairs of users/items not labelled
% -- noisiness of pairwise labels? (btw can we use our model to combine implicit labels for a single user --> ground truth for this user --> not all sources of data agree with true orderings). 
% -- benefits of BMF
% -- use of GPs for BMF?

%uchida2017entity -- learning preferences from user reviews
%APRIL paper from Alex? As a motivating example of why we need to learn preference function.

% A crowd may not necessarily consist of individual human annotators working towards a common goal of annotating a dataset. 
% It may be separate users of a system, whose individiual preferences we wish to predict,
% or we may treat the same user carrying out different tasks as a separate individual.  
% Each user may also generate labels for different types of user interaction.
% Hence, we can go beyond simple user-item matrices to treat each type of annotation  
% as a different 'user', and thereby combine different sources of information.
% Like the workers in a crowd, each source of annotations has a particular correlation with a ground truth
% that we wish to predict, i.e. the preferences for a particular user in a specific context.
% We must learn this correlation by identifying the ground truth from either explicit user ratings
% or consensus between relevant sources of information, defined a priori.

%The experiments section notes the three main benefits of our method:
% a) recovering an underlying consensus from noisy pairwise labels; --> 1
% b) modeling personal preferences from pairwise labels;  --> 1
% c) the scalability of our proposed Bayesian preference learning methods, GPPL and crowd-GPPL using SVI. --> 2
% d) ? test the hyperparameter learning method to see if it improves cost of learning
% over gradient-free methods.
% Is this the clear benefit or are we missing something else?
% Are these mentioned below?

Structure of the introduction:
motivate pairwise preference learning;
motivate desire to find consensus from crowds;
motivate modelling individual preferences for subjective tasks;
why a combined model?
Limitations of current methods at a high level.

Supervised learning relies on gold-standard labeled data for training, yet 
many tasks are subjective or are difficult for even expert annotators to reach agreement on. For instance, in natural language processing tasks such as
argument mining or summarisation, the most important arguments or sentences 
to extract from a document may depend on the background knowledge of an individual user and their current information needs. From the user's point of view, the most effective solution to the task may be to find arguments that are more convincing to the user or sentences that contain information that is new to the user. 
Similarly, recommendation tasks depend on the needs and prior experience of the user.
In such user-dependent cases it is difficult to obtain a calibrated and verifiable 
score for each item (argument, sentence, or item to consider recommending),
since (a) we cannot query the user a large number of times and (b) the annotation tasks are inherently difficult.

Structure of related work should also follow these questions:
preference learning from crowds (okay); 
Bayesian preference learning (where does it fit in these points? Small data/extrapolation to new examples);
Bayesian matrix factorization (again, Bayesian part needs to be linked in better; this is about personal preference learning);
SVI (okay, fits scalability part; but maybe talk about scalable Bayesian methods in general?);
Nothing about hyperparameters (Nickisch, maybe don't separate this point out but make it part of the scalable Bayesian inference method?).

% structure below is a little confusing? I think only a list of contributions + one or two questions is correct.
In this paper, we develop methodology to solve the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can we learn  user preference functions over large sets of items given a large number of pairwise comparisons?
  \item How do we account for the different personal preferences of annotators when inferring a consensus preference function?
  \item Can we provide a Bayesian approach to account for uncertainty in our learned model and confidence in its predictions? 
\end{enumerate}
To answer these questions we make the following technical contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We propose a model of both personal preferences and the consensus of a crowd 
  that aggregates pairwise preference labels
  % using a model of the noise and biases of individual annotators. % say why this is not possible with Dawid and Skene
  \item %To enable collaborative preference learning % collaborative preference learning needs to be defined above
   To enable inference on our model at the scale of large, real-world datasets, we develop
   stochastic variational inference for Bayesian matrix factorization and Gaussian process preference learning.
  \item To expedite hyper-parameter tuning, we introduce a technique for gradient-based length-scale optimization of Gaussian processes.
\end{enumerate}

The next section of the paper discusses related work.
We then we develop our model for preference learning from crowds in Section \ref{sec:model},
followed by our proposed inference method in Section \ref{sec:inf} and
hyper-parameter optimisation technique in Section \ref{sec:ls}.
Then, in Section \ref{sec:expts}, 
we evaluate our approach empirically, showing first its behaviour on synthetic data, 
then its scalability and predictive performance on several real-world datasets.
