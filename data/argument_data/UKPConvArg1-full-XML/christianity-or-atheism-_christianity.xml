      <text>One of the key component to Christianity is FAITH. Just you because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.

&lt;p&gt;But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

        <reason>A1 gives a clear example and is easy to understand, A2's purpose or point is unclear because there is too much written that doesn't connect.</reason>
        <hitComment>Very interesting format. However, I think having two arguments of noticeably different length adds bias to A2. Hope to do more of these HITs in the future as I am interested in debate now.</hitComment>

I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity, destroying your "test of time" argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be.
Although I'm religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my &amp;quot;faith to God&amp;quot; and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <text>I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <text>Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity, destroying your "test of time" argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity, destroying your "test of time" argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be.
Although I'm religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.</text>

      <text>Well though I behave as an atheist certainly I don't forget the principles and norms of Christianity;As this argument has heated up,Its better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well though I behave as an atheist certainly I don't forget the principles and norms of Christianity;As this argument has heated up,Its better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? Makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? Makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side.
Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>
