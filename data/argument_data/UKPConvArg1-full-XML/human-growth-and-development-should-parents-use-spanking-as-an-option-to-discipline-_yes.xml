      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people.

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people.

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There's a trend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people.

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>
