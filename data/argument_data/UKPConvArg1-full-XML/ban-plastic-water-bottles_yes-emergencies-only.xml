      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

In a situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not be legal because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Water bottles, good or bad? Many people believe plastic water bottles to be good. But the truth is water bottles are polluting land and unnecessary. Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergency purposes only. The water in those plastic are only filtered tap water. In an emergency situation like Katrina no one had access to tap water. In a situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not be legal because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Water bottles, good or bad? Many people believe plastic water bottles to be good. But the truth is water bottles are polluting land and unnecessary. Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergency purposes only. The water in those plastic are only filtered tap water. In an emergency situation like Katrina no one had access to tap water. In a situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not be legal because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Bottled water should be only used for emergencies weather it be natural or human disaster. To help people in need and not pollute in the environment and harm habitats by dumping in the ocean or in landfills. Plastic doesn't decompose so in that case do not use on for emergencies.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.</text>

      <text>If you don't save the bottled water for an emergency you are not thinking about later you are thinking about now. You are drinking bottled water when you don't even need to. Bottle water and tap water is the same thing. Bottled water-has more waste and you have to pay for it. Tap water-has all the same things as bottled except no price and no waste</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.

      <text>Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.
So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.
