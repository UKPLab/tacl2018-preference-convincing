      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

&lt;p&gt;But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.

And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.</text>

The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.
But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

Maybe I'm exaggerating.

      <text>yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

As previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .
Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .
So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups.

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups.

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school?

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.</text>

      <text>I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because school uniform improve student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time to choosing and buying clothes for school, espeacilly girls. That is why they can use more time to study.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>

      <text>If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.</text>

      <text>I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.</text>
