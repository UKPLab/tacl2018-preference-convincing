      <text>No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

        <hitComment>Very interesting study. Very subtle difference especially in the first two questions. I have a strong opinion on the spanking question as a parent with 2 kids that at one time used to spank them but decided it did not work and stopped. Now we have wonderful well adjusted kids that make wonderful choices ;)</hitComment>

      <text>No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.</text>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.</text>

      <text>No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people.

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

        <hitComment>I assume there is something being analysed aside from the actual arguments? But it is a little hard to choose between the yes/no/dontcare with complex issues like the creation of the universe. I am a christian but the sane kind who believes in evolution. I think children should be spanked but certainly not over trivial things.</hitComment>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people.

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

        <hitComment>None of these arguments were all that strong. In fact, most of them were pretty weak and contained poor writing. I would love to see each argument be a paragraph with introductory sentences, concluding sentences, and committed arguments.</hitComment>

      <text>Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

        <hitComment>As an American, the term agnostic is usually referrred as someone who believes there may or may not be a God.  Also, they may not have found a solution.  We do have an accurate account in Daniel 9:24-27 describes when the Messiah would return to Israel and Jesus did return during that timeframe.  We also have found that the Dead Sea Scrolls book of Isaiah translated and KJV of the Bible are a match.  The book of Ezekiel does prophesy something like a  holocaust and the return of the Jews to the land of Israel which has happened as well.  There are historical evidences for the epistles and accounts of Jesus walking planet earth as well.  Thank you for your time and this survey.  Check out harvestamerica.com for a free Christian concert &amp; klove.com.   Jesus loves you.</hitComment>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.</text>

      <text>Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

        <hitComment>As an American, the term agnostic is usually referrred as someone who believes there may or may not be a God.  Also, they may not have found a solution.  We do have an accurate account in Daniel 9:24-27 describes when the Messiah would return to Israel and Jesus did return during that timeframe.  We also have found that the Dead Sea Scrolls book of Isaiah translated and KJV of the Bible are a match.  The book of Ezekiel does prophesy something like a  holocaust and the return of the Jews to the land of Israel which has happened as well.  There are historical evidences for the epistles and accounts of Jesus walking planet earth as well.  Thank you for your time and this survey.

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <text>I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.</text>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option?

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <title>Human Growth and Development: Should parents use spanking as an option to discipline?</title>
      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>

      <description>As we have discussed, there are many forms of guidance techniques that help children learn self-control. Should spanking be an option? You are to pick your side, remember you must write a short analysis to the side you picked. Then you must write to two other people. You will support another person's view and you will dispute another person's view. This is a grade and I will be checking for your three posts.</description>
