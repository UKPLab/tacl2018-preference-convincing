      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well?

      <text>Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join.

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.</text>

      <text>while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.
Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?</text>

      <text>No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.</text>

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>

      <text>OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups</text>
