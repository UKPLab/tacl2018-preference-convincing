      <text>Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

      <text>Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

      <text>Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

      <text>Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts!

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <text>Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <text>Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&amp;#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>U.S. alone grew by over 13%. According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion.

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <text>Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>bottled water is not bad for the world because after youre done drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to have serval bottles of water using less plastic. plastic is also recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. it will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.</text>

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>bottled water is not bad for the world because after youre done drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to have serval bottles of water using less plastic. plastic is also recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. it will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

        <reason>A1 and A2 both use religion to support water bottles without providing an actual argument or reason. A1 and A2 both do not go into detail.</reason>
        <hitComment>Many of the "arguments" do not actually address the topic of debate. For example, for the third scenario, I selected the A2. A2 did not give an argument, just stated that "Jesus loves plastic water bottles", which as A) a false statement as water bottles did not exist during the time period with which Jesus is said to have lived, and B) doesn't actually provide information to construct an argument. A2 provides a supposed fact and then expects the reader to construct the argument on their own. But A2 actually addresses the topic at hand, while A1 is discussing an entirely different aspect of bottled water as it relates to frequency of recycling.  In the end, I just want to point out why these were difficult to address given how off-topic most of the arguments were. Thank you!</hitComment>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>"At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.
To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require."-nuff said

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

        <hitComment>This is an interesting HIT to work on, and I enjoyed reading the arguments listed. My concern was whether I was choosing the appropriate answer, particularly in the third argument. It instructed the two to write a paragraph, and A2 only had a sentence. I can't tell whether that was their full opinion or whether it was simply a portion of a larger paragraph that was chosen specifically for the HIT. Either way, good luck to you in your research.</hitComment>

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>

      <text>Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars.

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <title>Ban Plastic Water Bottles</title>
      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>

Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.

      <description>Some people think that bottled water is bad for consumers and should only be used in situations such as disasters when no other clean water is available. (Problems: Pollution, Shipping, BPA contamination, unfair profits, water mining, etc.)
http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/5-reasons-not-to-drink-bottled-water
Others believe that it is a natural and healthy portable drink and that it is good for the economy for the companies to make big profits.

      <text>Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.</text>
