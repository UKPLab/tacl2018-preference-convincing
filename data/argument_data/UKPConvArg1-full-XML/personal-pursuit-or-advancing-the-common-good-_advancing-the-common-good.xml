      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.</text>

If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want.

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.</text>

I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear &amp;quot;it's human nature to be selfish&amp;quot; or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help?

If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance.

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance.

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work.
The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.
When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."
Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run.

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that&#x2019;s what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that&#x2019;s not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it.

The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse.

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear &amp;quot;it's human nature to be selfish&amp;quot; or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself.

You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

&lt;p&gt;for his or her neighbor without being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where a person is in thier life....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time.

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves.

      <text>Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work.
The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves.

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work.
The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.</text>

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help?

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work.
The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.</text>

      <text>Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother.

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world.

      <text>Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <text>Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <text>advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.</text>

If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <stance>Advancing the Common Good</stance>
      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

&lt;p&gt;The word for this debate is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sacrifice] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much would a person really &amp;quot;sacrifice&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for his or her neighbor without being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where a person is in thier life....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

      <text>Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.</text>

      <text>I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.</text>

      <text>This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.</text>

      <text>Simply Written
Seeking to advance the Common good
allows doors to be opened and barriers to be
broken, and after a journey (or) series of
considerate acts one can have an less-difficult
time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.
The word for this debate is
[sacrifice]
How much would a person really "sacrifice"
for his or her neighbor without being
blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??
No matter where a person is in thier life....
Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did
(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!</text>

&lt;p&gt;broken, and after a journey (or) series of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;considerate acts one can have an less-difficult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time Persuing a &amp;quot;Personal&amp;quot; goal or Lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for this debate is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sacrifice] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much would a person really &amp;quot;sacrifice&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for his or her neighbor without being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blinded by the light beemed from selfishness??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where a person is in thier life....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>
