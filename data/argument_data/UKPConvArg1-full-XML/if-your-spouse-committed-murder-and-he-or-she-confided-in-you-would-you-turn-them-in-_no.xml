But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation.

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.</text>

Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.</text>

      <text>If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

&lt;p&gt;But Remember, when you say &#x201C;I DO&#x201D;, you&#x2019;re basically inviting the person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x2019;re marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.</text>

      <text>Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!</text>

      <text>No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.
Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.</text>

We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.</text>

      <text>I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in.

      <originalHTML>&lt;p&gt;If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it&#x2019;s a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it&#x2019;s a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did.

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

&lt;p&gt;I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Remember, when you say &#x201C;I DO&#x201D;, you&#x2019;re basically inviting the person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x2019;re marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.
Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.</text>

      <text>If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.
Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.</text>

      <text>If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

      <text>If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.</text>

      <text>Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.</text>

Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>

      <text>No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.
Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police
A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'
I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense
But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person
You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??
If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)</text>
