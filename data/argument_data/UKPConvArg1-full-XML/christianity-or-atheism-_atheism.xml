      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
With Athe&#xEF;sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I'd like to point out how few disputs there are on the Christian side, that's cuz free minded people dont need to convince other's. We know that there isn't a god, and that its up to us to make our lives.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

        <hitComment>It would be nice to have an example of what you would like us to write. It would also be helpful to have more solid arguments. I think both examples in most cases were weak or off topic. It was difficult to determine which one to chose or to toss both because they were both poor arguments to begin with.</hitComment>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only.

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is??? I AM an atheist and im a good person. the idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational &amp; impartial common sense.

The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.</text>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <text>Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

        <reason>A2 used no profanity; A1 used profanity 2xs.  Read Ezekiel 35 through 39: the Jews returned to Israel in 1948 and Ez was written ~2500 years before.</reason>
        <hitComment>As an American, the term agnostic is usually referrred as someone who believes there may or may not be a God.  Also, they may not have found a solution.  We do have an accurate account in Daniel 9:24-27 describes when the Messiah would return to Israel and Jesus did return during that timeframe.  We also have found that the Dead Sea Scrolls book of Isaiah translated and KJV of the Bible are a match.  The book of Ezekiel does prophesy something like a  holocaust and the return of the Jews to the land of Israel which has happened as well.  There are historical evidences for the epistles and accounts of Jesus walking planet earth as well.  Thank you for your time and this survey.

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

&lt;p&gt;Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</originalHTML>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

        <hitComment>These ask interesting questions, but in the answers, they seem to be based off of emotional opinions and not factual opinions.  That may be appropriate for the purpose of this study, but it makes it difficult to get a logical answer.</hitComment>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.
There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.</text>

The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only.

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.

&lt;p&gt;Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;)
I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.
It allows for more logic in my mind.</text>

      <title>Christianity or Atheism?</title>
      <description>Oh no, did I ask the great question that atheists can't stand to hear? Perhaps the negative position may be that the term "atheism" is incorrect? The argument that a person cannot be a christian because of his or her flaws is also quite weak. Christianity will stand the test of time as God is the one and the only. Scientists make scientific errors all of the time. Jesus Christ has never made a mistake and prophecies in the Bible have been and are still being fulfilled today. God has been a gracious Father to provide both the atheist and christian the solid evidence of His truth.</description>

      <text>Notmymuse,
Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.
I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).
Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.
Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.
-
Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.</text>
