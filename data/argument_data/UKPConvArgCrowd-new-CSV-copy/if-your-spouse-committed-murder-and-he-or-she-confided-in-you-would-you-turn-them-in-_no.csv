Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)

No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)
