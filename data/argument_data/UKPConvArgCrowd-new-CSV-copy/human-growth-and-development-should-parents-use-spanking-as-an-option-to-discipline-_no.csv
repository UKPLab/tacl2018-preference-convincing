The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.

The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again.
