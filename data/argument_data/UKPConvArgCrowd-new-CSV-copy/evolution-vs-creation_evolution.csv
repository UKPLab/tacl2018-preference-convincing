When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution

I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly.

Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) I believe in God and Evolution.	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution

806_794	A3QGFLKL2G6NJJ	a2	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	You can actually see evolution happen.

So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.

80854_803	ACY3ZOOZMVS7Y	a1	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution.

Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur? FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen.

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

806_821	A16KZJ538AEK39	equal	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions.

So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. :)	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.

We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.

That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.

Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions.

A good use of God's time.	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) I believe in God and Evolution.

It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap.

Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense.

I understand that people have religious beliefs and stuff, and thats fine by me people should be able to do what they without being judged on every move they make, but it's scientifically proven that the evolution is correct. What's your point?	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. It is the fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes it scientific rigor. I would recommend going tohttp://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

74907_72483	A2ZDXFFGSPHGBE	a1	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.	Why is this up for debate?

What's your point?	I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.

They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.

If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing.

I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited.

800_29310	ANBKIIG5BY8P8	a1	Peppered moths is the ULTIMATE straw man. The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic?

I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.	all i have to say on this issue is that there is actual evidence to support evolution!!

Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.	Peppered moths is the ULTIMATE straw man. The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.

All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.	Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument.

Monkeys haven't evolved to talk(by talk im guessing you mean speech) because they are incapable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk. Yes if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop monkeys from existing. We are a BRANCH on the tree of life. Not a dead end.

I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.	Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up; every generation our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it. I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.

That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.

816_74907	A3QGFLKL2G6NJJ	a1	This is this common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. . This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just dont try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down. http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/ganderson/es10/lectures/lecture01/sci.method.jpg	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution.

There's no concrete evidence that supports that god exists. Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence... Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations.

Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly.

So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology.

I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.	Evolution does occur and it has been documented, and studied. i invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give you your thoughts. thanks

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.	Really? What if I my opponent has ACTUALLY been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would that make your arguments any weaker?

Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic?

People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.	Evolution does occur and it has been documented, and studied. i invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give you your thoughts. thanks

That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.	"How come people aren't still evolving?" How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were. Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.

Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions.
