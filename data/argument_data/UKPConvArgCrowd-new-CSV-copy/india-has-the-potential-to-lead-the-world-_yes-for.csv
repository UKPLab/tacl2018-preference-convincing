For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.
