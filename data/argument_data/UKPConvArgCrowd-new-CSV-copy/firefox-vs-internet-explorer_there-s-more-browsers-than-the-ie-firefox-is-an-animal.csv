Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. So I think IE is better than firefox.

I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young.

For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier.

Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.	IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information.
