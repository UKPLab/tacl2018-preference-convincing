If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.

I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.

I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.

arg33070_arg33126	A3QGFLKL2G6NJJ	a2	I believe it is more important to have personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good.

I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others.

I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.

Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.

At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.

I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.

You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.

A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.

Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

arg33128_arg33102	A3QGFLKL2G6NJJ	equal	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be.

I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.
