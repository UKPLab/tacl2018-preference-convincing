63512_1683	A3B9VRPYFZSZ27	a1	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.

If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.
