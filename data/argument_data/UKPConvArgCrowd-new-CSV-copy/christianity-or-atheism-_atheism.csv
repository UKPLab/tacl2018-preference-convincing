Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.

arg229398_arg230365	AYJGJAIY0EXW	a1	Notmymuse, Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. - Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.	I'd like to point out how few disputs there are on the Christian side, that's cuz free minded people dont need to convince other's.

arg229241_arg229398	AB6C1SZWVNQCC	a1	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.	Notmymuse, Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. - Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.

I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.

I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.

Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. - Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.

I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
