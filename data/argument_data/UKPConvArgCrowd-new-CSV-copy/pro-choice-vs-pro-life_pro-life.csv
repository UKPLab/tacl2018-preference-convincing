The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection.

There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant.

13279_54474	A1PMKPD5QEU891	equal	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?

Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.

There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant.

And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.

"The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever." The government DOES have that right. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public there are many others. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.

There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.	My one question...

Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant!
