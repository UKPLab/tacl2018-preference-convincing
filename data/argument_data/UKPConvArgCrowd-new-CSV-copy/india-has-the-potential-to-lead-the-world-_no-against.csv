China will dominate, if not, US will. india will never get the chance to ruin the world!	according to a recent report 50% scientists in NASA are indian IITians, just imagine that if those scientists will join ISRO then our status,value and astronomical knowledge of india will definetly increase. Now,think abt. IITians,students who are qualifying iit, they are known to be superbrain.If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are unable provide them a perfect job of their level.we are giving international status of education.then why unable to take best advantages from them.this is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
