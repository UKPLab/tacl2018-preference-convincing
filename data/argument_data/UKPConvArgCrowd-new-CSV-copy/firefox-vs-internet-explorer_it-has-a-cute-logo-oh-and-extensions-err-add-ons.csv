Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons?

I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D	Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features.

The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer.

And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons?

The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/ OH AND. Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.

It remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS.

483_390	A3TKD7EJ6BM0M5	a2	No match. FF is better for my use in every way.	firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.

405_406	A1C0H8G0YI15MN	a1	I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D	Amazingly cool skins that let me pimp my browser and a built in spell check along with everything else that IE provides. Can't beat it.

There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often.

I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D	Honestly, firefox just works better.

From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?

There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?	Firefox has the user made extensions which cater for the user based community therefore it wins

The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/ OH AND. Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
