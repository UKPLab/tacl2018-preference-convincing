12402_12447	A1LHYSXO05EYRT	a2	From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let along right. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not.

I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? "...why challenge any assumption?" I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.

Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.	"This idea is essentially playing with semantics." I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? "...why challenge any assumption?" I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario.

It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)

However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok.

Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.

In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical.

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.

Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?	If being homosexual was natural then 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it.

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it.

We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".	Gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.

This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.	If being homosexual was natural then 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.

To debase marriage just to accomodate base desires of gay couples in disguise if a right is simply stupid...	Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?

And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.

No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it.
